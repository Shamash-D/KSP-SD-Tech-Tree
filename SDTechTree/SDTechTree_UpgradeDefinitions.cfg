	manufacturer = Research & Development Department
	description = We're quite proud to report that, with the design of some new, jointed tubing and the installation of better hydraulic systems run off a diverter valve from the fuel lines to provide the nessecary pressure, we've been able to devise a mechanism to turn even our most massive rocket engines. We'd also like appologize to whom ever owns the car from which we "borrowed" the first set of test articles. At you're request, the R&D team is willing to assign one of the engineering interns to find and install new, less explodified replacement hydraulics for you.

	basicInfo = We've extracted some insights from our refined models on combusion stability.
	manufacturer = Research & Development Department
	description = Combustion stability has been the bane of large combustion chambers since we started this endevior. Much time, effort, and sacrificial engines have gone into the design of simply what we have. Fortunately, with some new computers we've acquired for the R&D center, we've been able to construct a pretty comprehensive model of the fluid flow inside an engine bell and play with the parameters of our injector plates to find ever more ideal configurations that will provide the massive quantities of fuel to an engine without creating instabilities. No longer do we have to deliberately plant explosive charges inside our engines to verify that they'll maintain stable combustion (though that might still be a good idea to do regardless, sometimes the physics in this computer simulation we've built can be a little... finicky, we're not afraid to admit we're still dialing some of the parameters in).

The newer metalurgy we had to employ in the turbofan blades and cowl to make this happen have the added benefit of reducing the drama that should incure if one of the blades fail. We're sure your pilots and everyone else who interacts with these machines while they're on will appreciate that.
