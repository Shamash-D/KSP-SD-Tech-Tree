	basicInfo = Our larger SRBs can now thrust vector. *Optional Tech*
	manufacturer = Research & Development Department
	description = Thrust vectoring on a liquid rocket motor can be accomplished by actuating the thrust chamber, a technique that can't nessecarily be directly duplicated in a solid rocket motor, since the thrust chamber effectively stretches up the whole of the booster. None-the-less, we think we've managed to find some techniques that will produce analogous behavior with our larger solid rockets.
